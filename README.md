Project Motivation

 * For this project, I want to use open data source to analyze Boston Airbnb dataset complied on 10 June 2020 by Inside Airbnb. I will provide you with data visualization and machine learning solutions for three main questions that you would care about: Location: What regions do you have more choice or you are more likely to stay in Boston Airbnb? Room Type: What types of rooms are most popular for stay? Price: What are the important features to influence price? Could you predict the price of Boston Airbnb?
